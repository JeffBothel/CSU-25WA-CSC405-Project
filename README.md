# CSU Global CSC405: Graphics and Visualization Final Project
The code within this repo is for the Colorado State University Global Campus final project that was constructed for the course CSC405: Graphics and Visualization. This project has several elements that need implementation across multiple different deliverables for the course.

## Module 5 - Portfolio Milestone
### Original Prompt:
*This week’s discussion has introduced viewing, particularly with respect to various projections and related functions. In this assignment, you will briefly discuss several viewing functions (1-2 paragraphs) and then use the code snippet in section 5.4.6 to design an interactive Viewer using WebGL.*

*In your program:*
- *Include screenshots your working program*
- *Submit all the source files of your working program*
- *Submit your 1-2 paragraph Word document discussing viewing functions*

## Module 8 - Final Submission
### Original Prompt:
***Updates to Milestone from Module 5:***

*Based on instructor feedback, please provide updates to your interactive viewer activity from Module 5. Additionally, implement advanced interactivity features. For example, allow users to select and highlight parts of a complex object, switch between visualizations, or toggle between shaders. You will compile the updated source files with screenshots with your final project submission.*

***Lessons Learned Reflection:***

*Write a two-page summary that discusses the lessons you learned in this course. Reflect on how these lessons can be applied to a real-world problem or a specific real application. How will you use the concepts in this course going forward?*

***Final Program (Hidden-Surface Removal Problem):***

*Study the Hidden-Surface Removal problem and implement the Painter’s algorithm using WebGL. Provide one paragraph discussing what the Hidden-Surface Removal problem within your lessons learned reflection document.*

*Clearly provide the details of your program (provide a 2-paragraph overview), including the screenshots of your working program. Describe the object (primitive) that you are working with. Don’t forget to adequately comment your source code.*

*Assemble all of the requirements for this project and submit to Canvas for grading by the due date. As a reminder, there are no late submissions for Module 8, as everything must be submitted by the last day of the term.*
